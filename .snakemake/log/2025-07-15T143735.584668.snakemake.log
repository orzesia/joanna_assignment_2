Error in rule alignment:
    jobid: 0
    input: results/raw/reference.fasta, results/raw/SRR1972739.fastq
    output: results/aligned/aligned.sam
    shell:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job alignment since they might be corrupted:
results/aligned/aligned.sam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
