    reason: Missing output files: results/raw/reference.fasta.btw, results/raw/reference.fasta.amb, results/raw/reference.fasta.sa, results/raw/reference.fasta.pac, results/raw/reference.fasta.ann

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule bwa in file /home/ubuntu/binf5506/Snakefile, line 50:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/raw/reference.fasta.btw
Removing output files of failed job bwa since they might be corrupted:
results/raw/reference.fasta.amb, results/raw/reference.fasta.ann, results/raw/reference.fasta.pac, results/raw/reference.fasta.sa
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
