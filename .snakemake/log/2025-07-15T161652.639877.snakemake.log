MissingOutputException in rule validate_bam in file /home/ubuntu/binf5506/Snakefile, line 82:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/aligned/aligned.sorted.bam.validation.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
