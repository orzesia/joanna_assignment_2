Error in rule snpEff_database:
    jobid: 0
    input: results/snpEff/snpEff.config

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job snpEff_database since they might be corrupted:
results/snpEff/snpEff_reference_db.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
